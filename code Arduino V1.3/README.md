This code is part of the sample application provided with Orange IoT Starter KiT based on LoRa(R) technology (*) .
It is composed of an arduino code (to be loaded on the starter kit), and a Web App code.

(this part) The device sends periodically -every 2 minutes 10 seconds- a message containing the last state of the LED and luminosity sensor value, and can process a command coming from the Web app to turn on/off/blink a led.

The web application is used to pull data sent by the starter kit and command a Led on the starter KiT.
